This project uses [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/). Mantine comes with it's own default styles, but we can override them using [Theme object](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/) and [CSS](https://mantine.dev/styles/styles-overview/).

For components structure, this project utilises [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).
